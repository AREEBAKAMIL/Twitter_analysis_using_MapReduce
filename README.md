# Twitter_analysis_using_MapReduce
In this repository, i analyzed the real twitter dataset using MapReduce to extract:
1. Number of tweets made per day
2. number of times each hashtag was used

# About the dataset
The dataset consists of a line in each row, where each line constains 4 fields as follows:
  0              1                2                      3
 epoch_time ; tweetId ; tweet(including #hashtags) ; device
